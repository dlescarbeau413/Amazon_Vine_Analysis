# Amazon_Vine_Analysis


For this module, we used datasets that contained reviews of specific products and used Pyspark to preform the ETL process to extract and transform the data to eventually load the dataset into PgAdmin. After loading the data into pgadmin, we were tasked with filtering the Vine data to determine if having a paid vine subscription makes a difference in the percentage of 5-Star reviews. 


Results:
-The total number of vine reviews for this specific dataset that had a helpful vote percentage of 50% or more was a total of 333 reviews. 

![]()
-The total number of non-vine reviews in this data with a helpful vote percentage of 50% or more was 61,474 total reviews

Summary:


For this specific dataset, you can see there isnâ€™t much bias in the Vine program. We can actually see in this dataset that the total number of non-vine reviews that were 5-star is actually greater than the total number of vine reviews that were 5-star. In order to investigate further if there is any bias towards the vine review or not, we could use the same process on different datasets to see if there is a trend with different types of products.
